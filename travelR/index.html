        <h1>Travel</h1>

This webpage offers insight for your traveling needs, whether you are a constant traveler or a once-a-year kind of person. The Travel Methods page offers things you can consider when planning how to get somewhere, where the Things to Keep in Mind page has tips on what to bring with you.</p>

            <div class="category">Time</div>
            <p>The time that it takes to get to where you want to go can be very important when you do not have much time between studies and your schedule. To take less time, you may need to pay more. Planning ahead can help with this, as booking prices rise the closer it is to the travel date.</p>

            <div class="category">Distance</div>
            <p>The Distance you travel will affect the time it will take to get there and the cost of vehicles. If you were to travel 200 miles for example, a Car would cost $44-$104 depending on if you are renting or own a car. A plane would cost $140-$200 from a trusted airline. If you are to travel 500 miles, a plane would cost around $200, where a car would be $208.</p>

            <div class="category">Cost</div>
            <p>What most of us are worrying about, the cost. To save on costs, we have to sacrifice other things. Personal space is a luxury that we may not have during travel. The time we have to spend in a car may also be greater. By using the way that has less demand, the price can be better.            </p>
