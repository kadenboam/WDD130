            <p class="row">Traveling by car is usually the most all around solution to get to where you need to go. Planes and buses have limited locations they can travel to, which can be a hassle. The bad side is that you have to buy gas for the trip. You also have to stay focused and awake while driving. While it is the easiest method to use, it takes more effort and sometimes more time. When traveling with a few people, it is optimal option to choose.</p>
            <p class="row">Traveling by bus can be complicated with the specific pickup and drop off locations. However, on long trips it can be a great time to use. You can work on schoolwork, get caught up on sleep, or even watch a movie. Because of the limited locations it goes, getting from point A to B can be the fastest with this method, as long as your A to B aligns with the bus's. </p>
            <p class="row">Traveling by plane is the fastest way to go for long distances, but does have it's drawbacks. Planes are limited on the items you can bring along, which can be a problem if you are bringing bulky items. The cost is also much higher than the other two forms. Even with these drawbacks, if you need to make it home for the holidays or make your siblings life events, planes can be handy. The biggest downside is the closest airport is in idaho falls, so you would still need to use a car or bus to get there. </p>

                    <p>One of the best websites for searching for plane tickets is Cheap flights, as they redirect you depending on your prefered airline, pricing, and dates. Another similar option you could try is Expedia. It is recomend to visit both, and comparing the prices to get the best deal possible. Make sure to read the fine print though, as these websites may miss details or pricing fluctuation from the airlines.</p>
