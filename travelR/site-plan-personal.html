        Main Page - Travel
        This page mainly speaks upon general questions users would have about traveling, speaking upon distance and the recommended Travel Method (redirecting them to that page), addresses worries one might have about traveling, things that you can do to keep travel costs down
        
        Traveling as a college student can be hard, so we are here to help. This webpage offers insight for your traveling needs, whether you are a constant traveler or a once-a-year kind of person. The Travel Methods page offers things you can consider when planning how to get somewhere, where the Things to Keep in Mind page has tips on what to bring with you.
        
        When traveling, it is important to consider three things. Distance, Time, and Cost.
        
        The Distance you travel will affect the time it will take to get there and the cost of vehicles. If you were to travel 200 miles for example, a Car would cost $44-$104 depending on if you are renting or own a car. A plane would cost $140-$200 from a trusted airline. If you are to travel 500 miles, a plane would cost around $200, where a car would be $208.
        
        The time that it takes to get to where you want to go can be very important when you do not have much time between studies and your schedule. To take less time, you may need to pay more. Planning ahead can help with this, as booking prices rise the closer it is to the travel date. 
        
        What most of us are worrying about, the cost. To save on costs, we have to sacrifice other things. Personal space is a luxury that we may not have during travel. The time we have to spend in a car may also be greater. By using the way that has less demand, the price can be better.
