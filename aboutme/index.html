            My name is Kaden, and I am a freshmen setting out to get a Bachelors degree in Software Engineering. I have always likaed taking stuff apart, and anything that has to do with technology. 
            I like cats, because they are funny and cute. Webb design is something that I have always wanted to learn, and someday I hope that I can make my own cool website. Seeing as how the internet is becoming on of the greatest influences in our day, being able to create my own website would prove to be usfull. I know some spanish too, so creating a spanish website would be cool as well.

            I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all of my life. One of my favorite quotes of church leaders would have to be "Beware of Pride" by Ezra Taft Benson. One of my favorite scriptures is D&C 6:36, while also being one of the first ones I had memorized. They both have great messages aboyt humility and looking unto the lord.
